Welcome to the **Load Frequency Control** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for simulating power systems and implementing load frequency control (LFC) strategies. Designed for researchers, engineers, and students, our repository offers tools to model and analyze the dynamic behavior of power systems under varying load and Renewable Energy sources (RES) conditions, ensuring stable and efficient operation.


## Key Features

- Dynamic Simulation: Simulate the behavior of power systems under different operational scenarios, including generation, transmission, and distribution.
- Load Frequency Control (LFC): Implement and test various LFC strategies to maintain system frequency within desired limits, ensuring stability and reliability.
- Visualization Tools: Generate clear and informative plots to visualize system performance, frequency deviations, and control actions.
